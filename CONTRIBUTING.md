## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by the [Rocket.Chat Code of Conduct](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please read and follow it to ensure a respectful and inclusive environment for all contributors.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
3. Follow the instructions below to set up the development environment.
4. Identify an issue or feature you want to work on or create a new issue to discuss your ideas.
5. Before starting the implementation, discuss your approach in the issue comments to ensure that your work aligns with the project's direction and goals.

## Setting Up the Development Environment

To set up the development environment for the Rocket.Chat Flutter SDK, follow these steps:

**Local Setup**

Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Rocket_Chat_FlutterSDK.git
   ```

Congratulations. ðŸŽ‰.  You've successfully cloned our repository, and you are ready to make your first contribution. Before you can start making code changes, there are a few things to configure. 

**Melos Setup**

RCFlutterSDK uses `Melos` to manage our mono-repository. For those unfamiliar, Melos is used to  split up large code bases into separate independently versioned packages. To install Melos, developers can run the following command:

```bash
pub global activate melos 
```

Once activated, users can now "bootstrap" their local clone by running the following:

```bash
melos bootstrap
```

Bootstrap will automatically fetch and link dependencies for all packages in the repository. It is the Melos equivalent of running `flutter pub get`.

You're all set, Happy coding!

## Building the Project

When building a package, you will not receive a standalone output file like an APK or an app bundle, as the package is meant to be used as a dependency in other Flutter projects. **Ensure that the package is built without any errors and can be easily imported and used in other projects** using following command:

1. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   melos bootstrap
   ```

2. Run test with melos, hit:

   ```bash
   melos run test
   ```

3. Analyze code with melos, hit:

   ```bash
   melos run analyze
   ```

4. Compile and dry-run publish with Melos, hit:

   ```bash
   melos run publish
   ```

### Build Artifacts

For the sample apps included in each package, you can build them as you would with any other Flutter application, and you'll get an output file (e.g., APK for Android) after the build process is completed.

To build a sample package: 

1. Navigate to the app's root directory

   ```sh
   cd rocket_chat_api/sample_app
   ```
   or
   ```sh
   cd rocket_chat_embeddedchat_component/sample_app
   ```
2. Get all dependencies

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Run:
   ```bash
   flutter build <platform>
   ```

Replace `<platform>` with the platform you are targeting (e.g., `apk`, `ios`, `web`).
After building, the artifacts for each sample apps will be located in the following directories:

- `rocket_chat_embeddedchat_component`: `packages/rocket_chat_embeddedchat_component/sample_app/build/outputs`
- `rocket_chat_api`: `packages/rocket_chat_api/sample_app/build/outputs`

### Error Logs

If the build process encounters any errors, check the terminal or debug console in your development environment (e.g., VSCode) for error messages and stack traces.

## GitHub Actions CI

The project is integrated with GitHub Actions CI, which automatically builds and tests the packages on every push and pull request. The CI configuration can be found in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

### CI Logs

If the CI process fails, logs can be accessed from the "Actions" tab in the GitHub repository. Click on the specific run, and then select the failed job to view the logs.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the build process or while using the package, follow these steps to troubleshoot:

1. **Check the build logs**: Make sure to carefully examine the build logs in the terminal or your IDE's debug console for any error messages or warnings.
2. **Verify dependencies**: Double-check your `pubspec.yaml` file to ensure that all dependencies are listed and their versions are compatible.
3. **Flutter doctor**: Run `flutter doctor` to identify any potential issues with your Flutter installation or development environment.
4. **Clean and rebuild**: Sometimes, issues can be resolved by simply cleaning your project's build cache and rebuilding. Run `flutter clean` followed by build instruction to perform a clean rebuild of your project.
5. **Search for known issues**: Check the package's GitHub repository for any reported issues or ongoing discussions related to your problem.
6. **Ask for help**: If you're still having trouble, don't hesitate to reach out to the Rocket.Chat community or create a new issue on the GitHub repository.

For more specific guidance on troubleshooting, please provide detailed information about the issue you're facing, including error messages, logs, and any steps you've already taken to resolve the problem.
