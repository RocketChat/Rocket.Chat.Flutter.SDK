## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by the [Rocket.Chat Code of Conduct](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please read and follow it to ensure a respectful and inclusive environment for all contributors.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
3. Follow the instructions below to set up the development environment.
4. Identify an issue or feature you want to work on or create a new issue to discuss your ideas.
5. Before starting the implementation, discuss your approach in the issue comments to ensure that your work aligns with the project's direction and goals.

## Setting Up the Development Environment

To set up the development environment for the Rocket.Chat Flutter SDK, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Rocket_Chat_FlutterSDK.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```sh
   cd rocket_chat_api
   ```
   or
   ```sh
   cd rocket_chat_embeddedchat_component
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```sh
   flutter pub get
   ```

### Local Setup

Congratulations. ðŸŽ‰.  You've successfully cloned our repository, and you are ready to make your first contribution. Before you can start making code changes, there are a few things to configure. 

**Melos Setup**

RCFlutterSDK uses `Melos` to manage our mono-repository. For those unfamiliar, Melos is used to  split up large code bases into separate independently versioned packages. To install Melos, developers can run the following command:

```bash
pub global activate melos 
```

Once activated, users can now "bootstrap" their local clone by running the following:

```bash
melos bootstrap
```

Bootstrap will automatically fetch and link dependencies for all packages in the repository. It is the Melos equivalent of running `flutter pub get`.

Bonus Tip: You can define and run custom scripts using Melos, We use custom scripts for all sorts of actions like testing, lints, and more. 

To run a script, use `melos run <script name>`.

Happy coding!
